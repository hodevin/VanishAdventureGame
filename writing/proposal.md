## Proposal by Devin Ho and Sweta Rauniyar


The final laboratory assignment requires us to work with our partner on
creating a project that would be based on one of the enlisted topics. We have
come to an agreement to do the final project on topic three: Interactive
Storytelling. 

We will be working on creating a program that wil allow the user to engage in
an adventure-style, story-based game. The user will be prompted to select one
option from a list of possible options at that current point in the game.
Depending on what the user is trying to do, they will select that option. The
program will produce desired outputs based on the user's requests. The user
will advance forward in different paths. Those paths could potentially lead to
different endings in the story-based game.

Some of the tasks that we will need to complete include: coming up with a
setting, making characters, constructing different scenarios leading to
different outcomes, and initializing a motive. Furthermore, in order to enhance
the program we will be creating certain drawings using a number of characters
that will make the program look visually appealing. We plan to work using two
java classes. We will be implementing the project requirements that include the
use of the three different data types, conditional logic, and iteration
constructs followed by the use of arrays.
