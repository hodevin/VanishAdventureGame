# Status Update by Sweta and Devin

Today, we worked on our source code in order to make the story line look more
captivating and have a direction. We worked on a lot of the formatting of the
print line statements to make it look more organized and player-friendly. In
addition, we incorporated different colors throughout our text-based adventure
game. We plan to add more blocks of code in order to further extend the
different directions the story can go. We will also add more text art to
accompany the different scenarios and make the program more appealing. The text
art will also include many different colors. We were struggling in displaying
characters such as backslash and underscore in our text art which are treated
in a special way in java. We figured that out from the assistance of the
Professor Kapfhammer. Our main motive is to make our program look and run
better and that depends a lot on our story line so we'll work on it in the
upcoming days.
